The color is indicating the type of item rented, i.e. \"dress\", \"gown\", \"sheath\".\n\nThere are clearly two main clusters in this dataset for \"rented for\" - the mainly blue cluster and the mainly orange one. The blue cluster consists primarily of gowns while the other is mainly dresses.\n\nThis is a simple example yet still very informative about how customers rent items for which types of occasions.\n\nEmbeddings are not only cool to visualize, as mentioned above, they also facilitate \"semantic search\". Semantic search denotes \"searching with meaning\" and with context when available. The goal is to infer what the user's intent is then find the most relevant results. This is different from \"lexical search\" where a search engine looks for literal matches of a query (or defined variants). Both have their strengths and weaknesses, which we encourage you to research further.\n\nSemantic search can be incredibly powerful in a customer experience setting. Specifically, they can help with recommendations (i.e. which product is similar based on reviews, descriptions, etc.) and - obviously - search (i.e. find me products with these phrases or words in their reviews).
