Similar to GitHub, it allows users to explore, create, clone, push repositories and so much more. Each pretrained checkpoint has its own repository and in most cases a descriptive README with code snippets to load and run the model. See the [bert-base-cased](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-cased) model repository as an example.\n\n**How to Use Pretrained Models**\n\nWhile the Hub is a great place to explore different tasks and pretrained models, we need the `transformers` or `diffusers` libraries in order to load and make predictions with pre-trained models. These two libraries reimplement the code of the state-of-the-art ML research such that vastly different models can be downloaded, loaded into memory and used in a unified way with a few lines of code.\n\nIn this task, you will learn how to use the `Auto` classes of `transformers` and the `from_pretrained` method to download and load any model on the Hugging Face Hub. For a full list of supported models, refer to the GitHub [README](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main#model-architectures).\n\n**What is the Auto Class?**\n\n`Auto` classes of the `transformers` are simply tools to load models and their data preprocessors in a unified way. Remember, the library reimplements each model such that they each have their own class (`BertModel`, `RobertaModel`, `T5Model`, etc.) with mostly uniform input and output data format across all models. transformers have the following `Auto` class types to load models and their data preprocessors:\n\n- `AutoModel` \n- `AutoModelForTASK>` (more on this below)\n- `AutoTokenizer` \n- `AutoFeatureExtractor`\n- `AutoImageProcessor`\n- `AutoProcessor`\n\n**Loading Models into Memory with from_pretrained**\n\nFor the first task, you will download the pretrained \"cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-emoji\" model and load the model and its data preprocessor into memory with the `from_pretrained(<REPO_NAME_OR_PATH>)` method. The \"cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-emoji\" is a text classification model that is trained to predict the emoji class ID of a given tweet.\n\n[cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-emoji](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-emoji) is a valid Git repository on the Hub and the `from_pretrained()` method downloads and uses the tokenizer specific [files](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-emoji/tree/main) from the model repository.","metadata":{},"id":"26fb43b1-9455-456e-a674-34b58e2faae2","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"### Instructions","metadata":{},"id":"0134cdbf-1fc6-46fc-8075-6211db727739","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"Use the `AutoTokenizer` and `AutoModel` classes to download a pre-trained language model from the Hub and load its data preprocessor.\n\n- Import `AutoTokenizer` and `AutoModel` classes\n- Call the `from_pretrained()` method for both classes using the target repository name as input \n- Identify the explicit class name of the pretrained model using the model configuration","metadata":{},"id":"ec2a3334-8917-41cb-9300-3977744e702b","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Import the AutoTokenizer and AutoModel classes from transformers\n\n\n# Load the pre-trained tokenizer of the \"cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-emoji\" model\n","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","executionTime":635,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Import the AutoTokenizer and AutoModel classes from transformers\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\n\n# Load the pre-trained tokenizer of the \"cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-emoji\" model\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-emoji\")","executionCancelledAt":null,"lastExecutedAt":1695629872158,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":97,"type":"stream"},"1":{"height":537,"type":"stream"},"3":{"height":257,"type":"stream"},"4":{"height":557,"type":"stream"},"10":{"height":237,"type":"stream"}},"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true,"source_hidden":false}},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"source":"**What from_pretrained() does**\n\nThe `from_pretrained()` method (see [docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained)) first searches for a model repository with the same name on the Hugging Face Hub but it also accepts a local path or a URL with the expected folder structure.
