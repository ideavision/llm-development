In this task, we'll need to:\n\n1. Generate vector embeddings for all documents in `docs`. We'll utilize OpenAI for this purpose. langchain provides a convenient helper for this task, `langchain.embeddings.openai.OpenAIEmbeddings`, which you can use to generate embeddings using the latest `text-embedding-ada-002` model.\n2. Populate the vector index in Pinecone with these embeddings. Fortunately, langchain also offers assistance with this through the [`langchain.vectorstores.Pinecone`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/pinecone) helper.\n\nThese two steps can be combined using the convenient helper method `.from_document` of the `Pinecone` class. This method accepts an embedding model as input and efficiently calculates the embeddings, subsequently uploading them to Pinecone. We will also introduce some control flow to the code to ensure we do not add data to the Pinecone index if it already contains data. To achieve this, we can make use of the `.from_existing_index` method of `Pinecone`.\n\nIn addition to storing vectors, Pinecone allows the storage of additional metadata. When using the langchain helpers, it automatically assumes that vectors should be created from the `page_content` property of each `Document`. All other properties will be included as metadata.\n\nYou can verify that everything has worked correctly by accessing the `imdb-movies` index in the Pinecone UI.\n\n![Pinecone UI showing the imdb-movies index](pinecone_ui_index.png)","metadata":{},"id":"9ea4d375-28be-4deb-a11d-960215c13589","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"### Instructions","metadata":{},"id":"290c64c4-c5d2-426f-bb71-2d98fdd2d89c","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"- Import `OpenAIEmbeddings` from `langchain.embeddings.openai` and `Pinecone` from `langchain.vectorstores` and `Index` from `pinecone.index`\n- Create the `embeddings` object, which should be an instance of `OpenAIEmbeddings`.

For instance, when asked \"What's a good movie about vikings?\", the movie 'The Northman' was returned as a result. It is important to note that we did not incorporate any measure of movie quality into the system, so the notion of the movie being \"good\" is not explicitly encoded in the embeddings. It is crucial to always consider the data provided to the system and interpret the results of the AI system within that context. To enhance the results, one approach could be to include information about the movie quality in the movie description.\n\nThe remarkable aspect of RAG is the ability to provide relevant context to the LLM within the prompt itself. In the aforementioned example, we would include a description of 'The Northman' in the prompt, enabling the LLM to generate factual information beyond its knowledge cutoff. 'The Northman' was released in 2022, while the knowledge cutoff for the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model is set at September 2021.\n\nNow that you understand how the retriever can be employed to retrieve relevant documents from the vector database, we need to devise a prompt that presents this information to the LLM when we pose a question.\n\nWe require two types of [prompt templates](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/):\n- A template that demonstrates how the information in relevant documents is presented to the LLM\n- A template that combines the context with the rest of the prompt\n\nSome example prompt templates are provided in the sample code below, which you are free to edit.
